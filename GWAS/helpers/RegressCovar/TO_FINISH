For now, this is prototype code, which I run on my laptop (better to debug it each time!).

Once mature (i.e. the names of the phenotypes to run GWAS on will be fixed)...
An sbatch shell script should be place in /home/mtomason/retina/GWAS
which calls the R code in this folder.
The R code should be appropriately parametrized.
